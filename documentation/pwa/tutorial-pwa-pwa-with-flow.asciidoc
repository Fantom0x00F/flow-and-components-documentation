= Creating PWA with Flow

Flow server can automatically serve needed resources for PWA. To enable this,
annotate application with `@PWA(name = "My Progressive Web Application", shortName="MyPWA")`.

[source,java]
----
@PWA(name = "My Progressive Web Application", shortName = "MyPWA")
@Route("")
public class MyPWA extends Div {
    public MyPWA(){
        setText("Welcome to my PWA");
    }
}
----


By doing this flow server will automatically serve *web manifest*, *service worker*,
*icons*, *offline page* and *installation prompt*. Also needed additions to
headers are added to application.

There may be only single `@PWA` -annotation per application and it must be placed
in parent layout of application or in a view annotated with `@Route`.
